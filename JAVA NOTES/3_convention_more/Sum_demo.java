/*
 * THERE ARE 2 TYPE IN NAMING
 * 
 * CONDITION : RUES
 *  THESE ARE AS PER JAVA COMPILER
 * CONVENTION : RECOMENTATION / SUGGESTION
 *  THESE AS PER CODING STANDARDS
 * 
 * 
 * THE PROGRAM CAN HAVE MULTIPLE CALSSES BUT ONLY ONE CLASS IS PUBLIC
 * 
 * PUBLIC KEYWARD
 * 
 * IF THE CALSS IS PUBLIC IN THAT CASE THE PROGRAM SAVE WITH SAME NAME 
 * 
 * STATIC KEYWORD
 * STSTIC METHOD /CLASS METHOD 
 * PUBLIC STATIC --> IF YOU WANT TO CONNECT ANY THING WITH CALSS (ASSOCIATION)
 * WE PLACE STATIC IN FROUNT OF IT 
 * AS EXECUTION IS START FROM MAIN THEN IF WE WANT THE EXECUTION OF THIS CALSS WE USE STATIC TERM BEFORE THAT METHOD
 * 
 * METHOD BLOCK OF CODE WHICH ONLY RUN WHEN IT IS COLLED
 * 
 * MAIN METHOD IS CALLED BY JVM/JRE ,SO IT DOSN'T REQUIRE TO CREATE OBJECT TO INVOKE THE MAIN METHOD , SO IT SAVE MEMORY.
 * 
 *  MAIN REPRESENT START-UP OF THE PROGRAM
 * 
 * TO COMPILE JAVA PROGRAM main() IS NOT COMPULSORY BUT TO EXECUTE main() MUST BE PRESENT
 * 
 * COMPILER SCAN THE CODE AT ONCE
 * 
 * 
 * NAMIND CONVENTION OF METHOD :
 * 
 * NMAE START WITH LOWER CASE.
 * 
 * IN CASE OF MULTIPLE LETTER FIRST LETTER IS LOWERCASE AND REST FIRST LETTER IS UPPER CASE 
 * 
 * EX getData(), setData() etc 
 * 
 * toUpperCase
 * 
 * void method
 * 
 * is a return type of a method 
 * 
 * it will not written any value
 * 
 * String[] arg is used for command line argument.
 * 
 * 
 * System.out.println();
 * 
 * print()--> print on same line & println() --> change line
 * 
 *       System.out.print("hello rakshit");
 *       System.out.println(" i am dd here");
 * 
 * it will print "hello rakshit i am dd here"
 * 
 * 
 * System --> is a calss : print --> method 
 * 
 * 
 * package  --> class --> variable/method
 * 
 * println is not from system class but it is declared in system class.
 * 
 * System is calss it lie in package Java.lang
 * 
 * in previous obj
 * 
 * for monitor display --> System.out
 * for keyboard data in   --> System.in
 * for print error on display --> System.err
 * 
 * 
 * a program can have multiple class but one calss is main
 * 
 * a class must be same as public if class name and file name is same.
 *
