        /*
         * public calss name is same as class name
         * 
         * because JVM IDENTIFY THR LOCATION OF main()
         * 
         * can we compile empty.java file
         * 
         * yes empty .java program file can be compile but not generate .class file
         * 
         * if we just write there 
         * 
         * class demo(){
         * 
         * }
         * 
         * then the .class file will make as class name
         * 
         * Naming condition / rules are same for all identifiers where as naming conventions
         * are different for Type[class,interface,enum] and Type Member.
         *   
         * a sequence of characters to identify something in a program. They are names given to 
         * a class, variable, package, method, or interface and allow the programmer to refer to the s
         * pecific item from any place in the program
         * 
         * value assign to identifer constant boolean is calss literals
         * 
         * 
         * naming convention are different for Type and Type member
         * 
         * ClassName  --> should start with upper case letter eg Stirng Color,Button System, Thread.
         * 
         * 
         * interface name	should start with uppercase letter and be an adjective e.g. Runnable, Remote, ActionListener etc.
         * 
         * method name	should start with lowercase letter and be a verb e.g. actionPerformed(), main(), print(), println () etc.
         * 
         * variable name	should start with lowercase letter e.g. firstName, orderNumber etc.
         * 
         * object reference name 	should start with lowercase letter e.g. contractEmployee , permanentEmployee etc.
         * 
         * package name	should be in lowercase letter e.g. java, lang, sql, util etc.
         * com.infomatics.dev.test
         * 
         * constants name	should be in uppercase letter. e.g. RED, YELLOW, MAX_PRIORITY etc.
         * 
         * 
         * WHAT HAPPENED AT RUNTIME?
         * 
         * Test.java --> javac --> Test.class --> JVM
         * 
         * 
         * difference between JDK , JRE , JVM
         * 
         * JVM IS THE SPECIFICATION AND JRE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION
         *  MAKAN KA NAHSHA              AND A REAL HOUSE IS JRE
         * 
         * JVM  IS A ABSTRACT MACHINE (WHICH WE CAN FEEL DAYA)
         * IT PROVIDE RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH JAVA BYTE CODE CAN BE EXECUTE
         * 
         * JVM JDK JRE IS PLATEFORM DEPENDENT 
         * 
         * JAVA IS INDEPENDENT
         * 
         * JDK CONTAIN  JRE + DEVELOPMENT TOOLS (javac, jsvs, javap, javadoc, jar, appletiviewer, rmic etc)
         * 
         * it provide rintime environment
         * it is implementation of JVM (naksha)
         * 
         * jre = jvm + Java Packages Classes(like util, math lang, awt ,swing etc) + runtime libraries (jars).
         * 
         * 
         * JVM perform the following taska
         * 
         * Load code          calss loder
         * Verification code      byte code verifier
         * Executes code           
         * Provide runtime environment
         * 
         * JIT   just in time compiler
         * 
         * JAVA IS PORTABLE
         * 
         * SDLC  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
