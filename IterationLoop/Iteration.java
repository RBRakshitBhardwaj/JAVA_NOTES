         * 
         * we should use for loop when we want to perform a specific task for a definat number of times.
         * 
         * in while loop a block of statement gets executed repeatedly unless the given condition is false.

         * while loop is Unfixed/Indefinate or Unknown iterative loop
         * 
         * whaen we want to repeat a particular task at least once whether condition is false in that case we use do while loop
