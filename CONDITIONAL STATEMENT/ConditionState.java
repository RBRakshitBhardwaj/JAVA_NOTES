         * fall through = if there is no break in statement in switch case.

         * CONTROL VARIABLE :
         * 
         * variable given in a bracket of switch this is called as controlled variable.

         * facts of switch case :
         * 
         * default ststement can be use any where.
         * 
         * we cannot use variable after case.
         * 
         * if u want to use the variable after the case in that case that variable must be final.
         * 
         *  final means whose value cannot be change.
         * 
         * final var = 20;
         * 
         * case var:
         *    sout   it will not give any error.
         * 
         * var answer ; not correct.
         * 
         * here answer variable will not work because we have'nt give value to variable at point.
         * var answer =1; is correct
         * 
         * int a, var b=3; //dose not compile.
